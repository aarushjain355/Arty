<h0>**An Image Processing Desktop Application**<h0>


Arty is a desktop application created for users who like to cartoonify images of their food. Users can just enter in a keyword that is their food item and the application will download 5 images of that food through accessing the OpenSplash API. Afterwards, Arty uses many openCV algorithms and image processing technoques such as median blurring, edge masks, and color quantization to cartoonify the image with pre-specified paramters and then proceeds to download those images to the current working directory as well. The app then displays these images to the user on the GUI.

The application involes the use of the os library to download and delete the images every time the application is accessed.
